[G] I won't even [G] wish for snow 
[C] I'm just gonna [C] keep on waiting [Cm] underneath the [Cm] mistletoe
[G] I won't make a [G] list and send it [G] to the North Pole [G] for Saint Nick
[C] I won't even [C] stay awake to [Cm] hear those magic [Cm] reindeer click
[G] I just want you [G//] here to[B7//]night

[G] What more can I [E7] do?
Baby, [Am] all I want for [D] Christmas is [G] you
[Em] [C] You, [D] baby

[B7] Oh-oh, all the [B7] lights are shining so [Em] brightly every [Em]where
[B7].. And the [B7] sound of children's [Em] laughter fills the [Em] air 
[Cm].. And every[Cm]one is singing 
[G] I hear those [E7] sleigh bells ringing

[Am/] Santa, won't you bring me the [Am/] one I really need? 
Won't you [D/] please bring my baby to me? 

[G] I don't want a [G] lot for Christmas 
[G] This is all I'm [G] asking for
[C] I just wanna [C] see my baby [Cm] standing right out[Cm]side my door
