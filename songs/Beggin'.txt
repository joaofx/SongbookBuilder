(Intro)
[F/] Put your loving [Dm/] hand out, baby [E7/]
I'm beggin'

(Chorus)
[Am] Beggin', [F] beggin' you
[Dm] Put your loving [E7] hand out, baby
[Am] Beggin', [F] beggin' you
[Dm] Put your loving [E7] hand out, darling

(Verse)
[Am] Riding high, [F] when I was king
[Dm] Played it hard [E7] and fast, 'cause I had everything
[Am] Walked away, [F] wonderin' then
[Dm] But easy come [E7] and easy go and it would end

(Chorus)
[Am] Beggin', [F] beggin' you
[Dm] Put your loving [E7] hand out, baby
[Am] Beggin', [F] beggin' you
[Dm] Put your loving [E7] hand out, darling

(Bridge)
[Am] I need you [F] to understand
[Dm] Tried so hard [E7] to be your man
[Am] The kind of man [F] you want in the end
Only [Dm] then can I begin to [E7]  live again

(Verse)
[Am] An empty shell, [F] I used to be
[Dm] Shadow of my [E7] life was hangin' over me
[Am] A broken man [F] that I don't know
[Dm] Won't even stand [E7] the devil's chance to win my soul

(Chorus)
[Am] Beggin', [F] beggin' you
[Dm] Put your loving [E7] hand out, baby
[Am] Beggin', [F] beggin' you
[Dm] Put your loving [E7] hand out, darling

(Bridge)
[Am] I'm fighting hard [F] to hold my own
[Dm] No, I just can't make it [E7] all alone
[Am] I'm holding on [F] I can't fall back
[Dm] I'm just a con [E7] 'bout to fade to black

(Chorus)<b> x2</b>
[Am] Beggin', [F] beggin' you
[Dm] Put your loving [E7] hand out, baby
[Am] Beggin', [F] beggin' you
[Dm] Put your loving [E7] hand out, darling
