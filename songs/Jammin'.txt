Intro: [Bm7]

We're [Bm7] jamming [E7]   
[G] I wanna jam it with [F#m] you,   
We're [Bm7] jamming [E7] jamming   
And I [G] hope you like jamming [F#m] too  

Ain't no [Bm7//] rules ain't no [E7//] vow, 
we can [Bm7//] do it any [E7//] how   
And [G] I ah know will see you [F#m] through     
'Cos ev‐ery [Bm7//] day we pay the [E7//] price 
with a [Bm7//] loving sacri[E7//]fice   
[G] Jamming till the jam is [F#m] through 

We're [Bm7] jamming [E7]

We're [Bm7] jamming [E7] jamming   
And I [G] hope you like jamming [F#m] too  

We're [Bm7] jamming [E7]   
To think that [G] jamming was a thing of the [F#m] past   
We're [Bm7] jamming [E7]   
And I [G] hope this jam is gonna [F#m] last 

No [Bm7//] bullet can stop us [E7//] now, 
we neither [Bm7//] beg nor we won't [E7//] bow   
[G] Neither can be bought nor [F#m] sold   
We [Bm7//] all defend the [E7//] right 
that the [Bm7//] children us [E7//] unite    
Your [G] life is worth much more than [F#m] gold  

We're [Bm7] jamming… jam[E7]ming… jamming… jamming   
And [G] we're jamming in the name of the [F#m] Lord   
We're [Bm7] jamming, jam[E7]ming, jamming, jamming   
[G] We're jamming right straight from [F#m] Jah 

[Bm7] Ho-oly mount [Em] Zion   
[Bm7] Ho-oly mount [Em] Zion   
[Bm7] Jah sitteth in [Bm7] Mount Zion   
[Bm7] And rules all Cre[Bm7]ation, yeah we're 

We're [Bm7] jamming [E7]   
[G] I wanna jam it with [F#m] you,   
We're [Bm7] jamming [E7] jamming   
And I [G] hope you like jamming [F#m] too  

Jah [Bm7//] knows I might have  [E7//] tried
The [Bm7//] truth I cannot [E7//] hide
[G] To keep you satis[F#m]fied
True [Bm7//] love I know [E7//] exist
It's [Bm7//] the love I can't [E7//] resist 
[G] So, jam by my [F#m] side 


We're [Bm7] jamming [E7]   
[G] I wanna jam it with [F#m] you,   
We're [Bm7] jamming [E7] jamming   
And I [G] hope you like jamming [F#m] too
