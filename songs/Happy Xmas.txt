So this is [A] Christmas
And what have you [Bm] done
Another year [E7] over
And a new one just [A] begun
               
And so this is [D] Christmas
And I hope you have [Em] fun
The near and the [A] dear one
The old and the [D] young

Chorus:             
A very merry [G] Christmas
And a happy New [A] Year
Let's hope it's a good [Em7] one [G]
Without any [D] fear [E7]
               
And so this is [A] Christmas [back](War is over) [/back]
For weak and for [Bm] strong [back](If you want it)[/back]
For rich and for [E7] poor ones [back](War is over)[/back]
The world is so [A] wrong [back](No-o-o-ow)[/back]
             
And so happy [D] Christmas [back](War is over)[/back]
For black and for [Em] white [back](If you want it)[/back]
For yellow and red [A] ones [back](War is over)[/back]
Let's stop all the [D] fight [back](No-o-o-ow)[/back]

Chorus:
A very merry [G] Christmas
And a happy New [A] Year
Let's hope it's a good [Em7] one [G]
Without any [D] fear [E7]
