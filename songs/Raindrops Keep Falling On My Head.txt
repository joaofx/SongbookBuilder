info:
- different key than original
- Am instead of Am7 <!-- first more obvious, second sounds nicer-->
<!-- ways of simplifying
*** second option gives us less switches between chords (6 instances below)
## skipping Gmaj7 single strums (2 instances below)
all instances of Gmaj7 could be changed to Bm7 to make it more beginner friendly, it sounds close enough

intro:
[G]...[D]...[C]...[D]...

[G] Raindrops keep fallin’ on my [Gmaj7] head
And [G7] just like the guy whose feet are [Cmaj7] too big for his 
[Bm7//] bed… [E7//] nothin’ seems to [Bm7//] fit… [E7//] those
[Am7] Raindrops are fallin’ on my [Am7] head, they keep fallin’ 

[C/] So [C/] I [D/] just <!--***or easier [D7/] So [D7/] I [D7/] just-->
[G] Did me some talkin’ to the [Gmaj7] sun
And [G7] I said I didn’t like the [Cmaj7] way he’d got things 
[Bm7//] Done [E7//] sleepin’ on the [Bm7//] job [E7//] those
[Am7] Raindrops are fallin’ on my [Am7] head, they keep fallin’ 

[C/] But [C/] there’s [D/] one <!--C D as in ***-->
[G] Thing… I [Gmaj7] know
The [C] blues they sent to [D] meet me won’t
De[Bm7]feat me... it [Bm7] won’t be long ‘til
[E7] happiness steps [Am7] up to greet me
([C//] [D/]) ([C//] [D/])

[G] Raindrops keep fallin’ on my [Gmaj7] head
But [G7] that doesn’t mean my eyes will [Cmaj7] soon be turning 
[Bm7//] Red [E7//] cryin’s not for [Bm7//] me [E7//] 'cause
[Am7] I’m never gonna stop the [Am7] rain by complainin’
[C/] Be[C/]cause [D/] I’m [G] free [Gmaj7/] <!--## Gmaj7 optional cause it changes really fast to Am, C//D/ as in ***-->

[Am7/] Nothin’s [D//] worryin’ [G] me... <!--Am7//D/ as in ***-->
[Gmaj7] ...[C] ... [D] ...[Bm7] ...
It [Bm7] won’t be long ‘til
[E7] happiness steps [Am7] up to greet me
([C//][D/]) ([C//][D/])

[G] Raindrops keep fallin’ on my [Gmaj7] head
But [G7] that doesn’t mean my eyes will [Cmaj7] soon be turning 
[Bm7//] Red [E7//] cryin’s not for [Bm7//] me [E7//] cos
[Am7] I’m never gonna stop the [Am7] rain by complainin’
[C/] Be[C/]cause [D/] <!--C//D/ as in ***-->
[G] Free-e [Gmaj7/] <!-- Gmaj7/ as in ##-->
(slower)
[Am7/] nothin’s [D/] worryin’ ...[Gmaj7/] me-e-e [G/] <!--Am7/D/ as in *** -->
