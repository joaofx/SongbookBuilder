intro:
[Dm] + riff x4

Ooh-ooh, [Dm] bet you wondered how I knew
'Bout your [A7] plan to make me [G] blue
With some other [Dm] GUY that you knew before
Between the two of us [A7] guys, you know I love you [G] more 
It took me by SURPRI-[Bm]-ISE I must [G] say
When I [Dm] found out yester-[G]-day

Ooh-ooh, [Dm] I heard it through the grapevine
Not much [G] longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, [Dm] I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm [G] just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey [Dm] yeah

[Dm] + riff x4

You know [Dm] that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these [A7] tears I can't hold [G] inside
Losin' [Dm] YOU'd end my life you see
'Cause you [A7] mean that much to [G] me
You could've [Bm] TO-OLD me your[G]self
That you [Dm] found someone [G] else

Instead [Dm] I heard it through the grapevine
Not much [G] longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, [Dm] I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm [G] just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey [Dm] yeah

[Dm] + riff x4

People say [Dm] ha-alf from what you see
Nah-nah-[A7]none from what you [G] hear
I can't [Dm] HELP but bein' confused
If it's [A7] true, won't you tell me [G] here?
Do you [Bm] PLA-AN to let me [G] go-o
For the other [Dm] guy that you knew [G] before?

Ooh-ooh, [Dm] I heard it through the grapevine
Not much [G] longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, [Dm] I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm [G] just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey [Dm] yeah

[Dm] +riff x4
