Crawling on your [A] knees toward him [E7] …
[F#m] Making momma so [D] proud
[A] But your voice is too [E7] loud

[A] You laughing [E7] …
[F#m] Picking insects off of [D] plants
[A] No time to think of conse[E7]quences

But it's sending [A] me shivers [E7] …

[A] Crying out for atten[E7]tion

[F#m] Memories [D] fade
Like looking through a [A]fogged mirror [E7]

[A]thought… this wouldn't hurt a [E7]lot, I guess not
