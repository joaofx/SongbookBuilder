Intro: 
[F] [Am] 
[F] [Am//] 

[G//] Oh 
[Am] life, .. is bigger 
[Em] it’s bigger than you   
And you are [Am] not me 
The lengths that I will [Em] go to   
The distance in your [Am] eyes [Am]    
[Em] Oh no I’ve said too [Dm] much
I’ve said e[G]nough   
{c: } 
That’s me in the [Am] corner 
That’s me in the [Em] spot light   
Losing my re[Am]ligion 
Trying to [Em] keep .. up with you   
And I [Am] don’t know if I can do it   
[Em] Oh no I’ve said too [Dm] much 
I haven’t said e[G]nough   
{c: } 
I thought that I heard you [F] laughing   
I thought that I heard you [Am] sing
I [F] think I thought I saw you [Am//] try ... 
[G//]   
 
Every [Am] whisper    
Every waking [Em] hour I’m choosing my con[Am]fessions   
Trying to [Em] keep eye on you   
Like a [Am] hurt lost and blinded fool, fool   
[Em] Oh no I’ve said too [Dm] much I said e[G]nough   
{c: } 
Consider [Am] this .. consider this [Em] hint of the century   
Consider [Am] this .. the slip .. that [Em] brought me to my knees pale   
[Am] What if all these fantasies come [Em] flaming around   
Now I’ve [Dm] said .... too [G] much   
{c: } 
I thought that I heard you [F] laughing   
I thought that I heard you [Am] sing  
I [F] think I thought I saw you [Am] try ... [G//]

But [C/]  that was just a [Dm/] dream

That’s me in the [Am] corner 
That’s me in the [Em] spot light   
Losing my re[Am]ligion 
Trying to [Em] keep up with you   
And I [Am] don’t know if I can do it   
[Em] Oh no I’ve said too [Dm] much 
I haven’t said e[G]nough   
{c: } 
I thought that I heard you [F] laughing   
I thought that I heard you [Am] sing
I [F] think I thought I saw you [Am] try 

But [F] that was just a dream ... 
[Am] try, cry, why, try
[F] That was just a dream, just a [Am//] dream, just a [G//] dream, dream
