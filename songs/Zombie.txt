Intro: [Em] [C] [G] [D]

[Em] Another [C]head hangs lowly
[G]Child is slowly [D]taken
[Em] And the violence [C]caused such silence
[G]Who are we mis[D]taken?

But you [Em]see… it's not me… it's not [C]my family
In your [G]head… in your head… they are [D]fighting
With their [Em]tanks… and their bombs
And their [C]bombs… and their guns
In your [G]head… in your head… they are [D]crying

In your [Em]hea-ea-ead… in your [C]hea-ea-ead
Zo-om[G]bie… zo-ombie… zo-om[D]bie hey hey
What’s in your [Em]hea-ea-ead… in your [C]hea-ea-ead
Zo-om[G]bie… zo-ombie… zo-om[D]bie hey hey hey
[Em]Oh [C] do-do-do
[G] Do-do-do [D] do-do-do

[Em] Another [C]mother's breakin'
[G]Heart is taking [D]over
[Em] When the violence [C]causes silence
[G]We must be mis[D]taken

It's the [Em]same old theme… since [C]1916
In your [G]head… in your head… they're still [D]fighting
With their [Em]tanks… and their bombs
And their [C]bombs… and their guns
In your [G]head… in your head… they are [D]dying

In your [Em]hea-ea-ead… in your [C]hea-ea-ead
Zo-om[G]bie… zo-ombie… zo-om[D]bie hey hey
What’s in your [Em]hea-ea-ead… in your [C]hea-ea-ead
Zo-om[G]bie… zo-ombie… zo-om[D]bie hey hey hey
[Em]Oh oh oh oh [C]oh oh oh oh
Ay [G]ohhhh ah ah [D]aaaah
