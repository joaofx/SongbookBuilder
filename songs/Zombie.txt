Intro: 
[Em] [C] [G] [D]
[Em] [C] [G] [D]

[Em] Another [C] head hangs lowly
[G] Child is slowly [D] taken…
[Em] And the violence [C] caused such silence
[G] Who are we mis[D]taken?…

But you [Em] see… it's not me… it's not [C] my family
In your [G] head… in your head… they are [D] fighting
With their [Em] tanks… and their bombs
And their [C] bombs… and their guns
In your [G] head… in your head… they are [D] crying

In your [Em] hea-ea-ead… in your [C] hea-ea-ead
Zo-om[G]bie… zo-ombie… zo-om[D]bie hey hey
What’s in your [Em] hea-ea-ead… in your [C] hea-ea-ead
Zo-om[G]bie… zo-ombie… zo-om[D]bie hey hey hey

[Em] do-do-do [C] do-do-do
[G] Do-do-do [D] do-do-do

[Em]... [C]... 
[G]... [D]...

[Em] Another [C] mother's breakin'
[G] Heart is taking [D] over
[Em] When the violence [C] causes silence
[G] We must be mis[D]taken

It's the [Em] same old theme… since [C] 1916
In your [G] head… in your head… they're still [D] fighting
With their [Em] tanks… and their bombs
And their [C] bombs… and their guns
In your [G] head… in your head… they are [D] dying

In your [Em]hea-ea-ead… in your [C] hea-ea-ead
Zo-om[G]bie… zo-ombie… zo-om[D]bie hey hey
What’s in your [Em] hea-ea-ead… in your [C] hea-ea-ead
Zo-om[G]bie… zo-ombie… zo-om[D]bie hey hey hey

[Em] Oh oh oh oh [C] oh oh oh oh
Ay [G] ohhhh ah ah [D] aaaah
