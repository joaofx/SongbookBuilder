[Em] Strumming my pain with his [Am] fingers   
[D7] Singing my life with his [G] words   
[Em] Killing me softly with [A] his song   
Killing me [D] softly with [C] his song   
Telling my [G] whole life with [C] his words   
Killing me [F] softly with his [E7] song  
{c: } 
[Am] I heard he [D7] sang a good song   
[G] I heard he [C] had a style   
[Am] And so I [D7] came to see him   
And [Em] listen for a while   
[Am] And there he [D7] was this young boy   
[G] A stranger [B] to my eyes

[D7] Singing my life with his [G] words   
[Em] Killing me softly with [A] his song   
Killing me [D] softly with [C] his song   
Telling my [G] whole life with [C] his words   
Killing me [F] softly with his [E7] song 
{c: } 
[Am] I felt all [D7] flushed with fever   
[G] Embarrassed [C] by the crowd   
[Am] I felt he [D7] found my letters   
And [Em] read each one out loud   
[Am] I prayed that [D7] he would finish   
[G] But he just [B] kept right on

Killing me [D] softly with [C] his song   
Telling my [G] whole life with [C] his words

{c: } 
[Am] He sang as [D7] if he knew me   
[G] In all my [C] dark despair   
[Am] And then he [D7] looked right through me   
As [Em] if I wasn't there    
[Am] And he just [D7] kept on singing   
[G] Singing [B] clear and strong

Telling my [G] whole life with [C] his words   
Killing me [F] softly with his [E7] song
