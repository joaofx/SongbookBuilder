Intro: (mute strums)

I stay out too [Em/] late... 
Got nothing in my [G/] brain
That's what people [D/] sa-ayy… mmm-mmm… 
That's what people sa-ayy… mmm-mmm

I go on too many [Em/] dates... 
But I can't make 'em [G/] stay
At least that's what people [D/] sa-ay… mmm-mmm… 
That's what people sa-ay… mmm-mmm (stop)

But I keep [Em] cruisin'… 
Can't stop won't stop [G] moving
It's like I got this [D] music… 
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright (stop)

(chorus:)
Cause the [Em] players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the [G] haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby
[D] I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off

Heart [Em] breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the [G] fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake baby
[D] I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off (stop)

I never miss a [Em] beat... 
I'm lightning on my [G]feet
And that's what they don't [D]see-ee… mmm-mmm… 
That's what they dont' see-ee… mmm-mmm

I'm dancing on my [Em] own (dancing on my own)
I'll make the moves up as I [G] go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't [D] know-ow, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know-ow, mmm-mmm (stop)

But I keep [Em] cruisin'… 
Can't stop won't stop [G] grooving
It's like I got this [D] music… 
In my mind, saying (stop) it's gonna be alright

(chorus:)
Cause the [Em] players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the [G] haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby
[D] I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off

Heart [Em] breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the [G] fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake baby
[D] I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off 

Cause the [Em] players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the [G] haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby
[D] I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off

Heart [Em] breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the [G] fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake baby
