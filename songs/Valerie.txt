Intro : [C] [Dm] (1st line)       
				
Well some [C] times I go out by myself and I look across the [Dm] water   
And I [C] think of all the things, what you're doing    
and in my head I make a [Dm] picture   
{c: } 
[F] 'Cos since I've come on home, well my [Em] body's been a mess   
And I've [F] missed your ginger hair and the [Em] way you like to dress   
[F] Won't you come on over, [C] stop making a fool out of [G] me   
Why won't you come on over Vale[C]rie? Vale[Dm]rie Vale[C]rie? Vale[Dm]rie   
{c: } 
Did you [C] have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale    
Did you get a good [Dm] lawyer?   
I hope you [C] didn't catch a tan, I hope you find the right man    
Who'll fix it [Dm] for you   
Are you [C] shopping anywhere, changed the colour of your hair,    
Are you still [Dm] busy   
And did you [C] have to pay the fine you were dodging all the time    
Are you still [Dm] dizzy?

[F] 'Cos since I've come on home, well my [Em] body's been a mess   
And I've [F] missed your ginger hair and the [Em] way you like to dress

Why won't you come on over Vale[C]rie? Vale[Dm]rie Vale[C]rie? Vale[Dm]rie
