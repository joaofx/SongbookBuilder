Am, Dm -intro x4
Am, Dm////E7/C (albo takie jak w elaphan ]g gun)/E7 - alternative
Am           G
Baby, do you understand me now,
F                E7
Sometimes I feel a little mad.
But, don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel.
When things go wrong I feel real bad.
C                     Am
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,
F        Dm           F         Am
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.
Am Dm x2

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree,
With a joy that's hard to hide.
And sometimes it seems that, all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side.

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.
F         G
If I seem edgy,
F             G
I want you to know,
F            G               C          Am
That I never mean to take it out on you.
FG
Life has its problems,
FG
And I get my share,
F                            E7
And that's one thing I never mean to do,
                 Am
'Cause I love you,
Oh,
SOLO
baby -  I'm JUST  human.
and I have thoughts like any other one.
Sometimes I find myself, Lord, regretting,
Some little things - some stupid things I've done.

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.
