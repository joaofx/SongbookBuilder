Intro: 
[Am]...[Dm]... x2 
<!--or 
[Am]...[Dm// E7/ C/ E7/] x2 -->

[Am] Baby, do you under[G]stand me now,
[F] Sometimes I feel a little [E7] mad.
[Am] But, don't you know that no one alive [G] can always be an angel.
[F] When things go wrong I feel real [E7] bad.

Well, [C] I'm just a soul whose [Am] intentions are good,
[F/] Oh Lord, [Dm/] please don't let me [F/] be misunder[Am]stood.

(same as intro)
[Am]  [Dm] x2

[Am] Baby, sometimes I'm so [G] carefree,
[F] With a joy that's hard to [E7] hide.
[Am] And sometimes it seems that, [G] all I have is worry
[F] And then you're bound to see my [E7] other side.

Well, [C] I'm just a soul whose [Am] intentions are good,
[F/] Oh Lord, [Dm/] please don't let me [F/] be misunder[Am]stood.

(same as intro)
[Am]  [Dm] x2
[F] If I seem [G] edgy,
[F] I want you to [G] know,
[F] I never [G] mean to take it [C] out on you-[Am]-u.
[F] Life has its [G] problems,
[F] And I get my [G] share,
[F] And that's one [G] thing I never [E7] mean to do,
'Cause I love [Am] you, Oh,

(same as intro)
[Am]  [Dm] x2

[Am] baby - I'm JUST [G] human.
[F] and I have thoughts like any other [E7] one.
[Am] Sometimes I find myself, [G] Lord, regretting,
[F] Some little things - some [E7] stupid things I've done.

Well, [C] I'm just a soul whose [Am] intentions are good,
[F/] Oh Lord, [Dm/] please don't let me [F/] be misunder[Am]stood.

[NC] pa pa-ra-ra pa-ra-ra - pa-ra-ra pa pa-ra x2
[Am] pa pa-ra-ra pa-ra-ra, [Dm] pa-ra-ra pa pa-ra x2

Well, [C] I'm just a soul whose [Am] intentions are good,
[F/] Oh Lord, [Dm/] please don't let me [F/] be misunder[Am/]stood.
