<i>(intro)</i> 
[Am] [E7] [G] [D] [F] [C] [Dm] [E7]  
 
<i>(verse)</i>
[Am] On a dark desert highway [E7] cool wind in my hair   
[G] Warm smell of colitas [D] rising up through the air   
[F] Up ahead in the distance [C] I saw a shimmering light   
[Dm] My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim   
[E7] I had to stop for the night   

[Am] There she stood in the doorway [E7] I heard the mission bell   
[G] And I was thinking to myself this could be [D] heaven or this could be hell   
[F] Then she lit up a candle [C] and she showed me the way   
[Dm] There were voices down the corridor [E7] I thought I heard them say   

<i>(chorus)</i>
[F] Welcome to the Hotel Cali[C]fornia   
Such a [Dm] lovely place such a [Am] lovely face   
[F] Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[C]fornia   
Any [Dm] time of year you can [E7] find it here  
 
<i>(verse)</i>
[Am] Her mind is Tiffany twisted [E7] she got the Mercedes Benz   
[G] She got a lot of pretty pretty boys [D] that she calls friends   
[F] How they dance in the courtyard [C] sweet summer sweat   
[Dm] Some dance to remember [E7] some dance to forget  
 
[Am] So I called up the captain [E7] please bring me my wine   
He said [G] we haven't had that spirit here since [D] 1969   
[F] And still those voices are calling from [C] far away   
[Dm] Wake you up in the middle of the night [E7] just to hear them say   

<i>(chorus)</i>
[F] Welcome to the Hotel Cali[C]fornia   
Such a [Dm] lovely place such a [Am] lovely face   
[F] Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[C]fornia   
Any [Dm] time of year you can [E7] find it here  

<i>(verse)</i> 
[Am] Mirrors on the ceiling [E7] the pink champagne on ice   
And she said [G] we are all just prisoners here [D] of our own device   
[F] And in the master's chambers [C] they gathered for the feast   
[Dm] They stab it with their steely knives but they [E7] just can't kill the beast  
 
[Am] Last thing I remember I was [E7] running for the door   
[G] I had to find the passage back to the [D] place I was before   

[F] Relax said the nightman we are [C] programmed to receive   
[Dm] You can check out anytime you like [E7] but you can never leave  

<i>(chorus)</i>
[F] Welcome to the Hotel Cali[C]fornia   
Such a [Dm] lovely place such a [Am] lovely face   
They [F] livin' it up at the Hotel Cali[C]fornia   
What a [Dm] nice surprise bring your [E7] alibis       
[Am/]
