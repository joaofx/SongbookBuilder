I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo ... in so much space 
mmm

And when you're out there ... without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough ...
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy
Does that make me crazy
Does that make me crazy
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
mmm
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you
Who do you think you are
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control

I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember ... is thinking I want to be like them 
mmm
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
 
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

uuuuu
