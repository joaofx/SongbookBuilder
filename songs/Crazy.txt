Intro:
[Am]... [Cmaj7]... [F]... [E7]...

[Am] I remember when… I remember, 
I remember when I lost my [Cmaj7] mind 
There was something so pleasant about that plaa[F]ce
Even your emotions had an echo, In so much spa[E7]ce

[Am] And when you're out there… without care
Yeah, I was out of tou[Cmaj7]ch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough [F] 
I just knew too [E7] much

Does that make me [Am] crazy?
Does that make me [Cmaj7] crazy??
Does that make me [F] crazy???
Possib[E7]ly...

[A] And I hope that you are 
ha-aving the time of your [F] li-ife...
But think [Cmaj7] twice... that's my only ad[E7]vice

[Am] Come on now who-do-you. Who-do-you, 
who-do-you, who do you think you [Cmaj7] are?
Ha ha ha, bless your so[F]ul
You really think you're in con[E7]trol? 

Well, I think you're [Am] crazy!
I think you're [Cmaj7] crazy!!
I think you're [F] crazy!!!
Just like [E7] me-e-e

[A] My heroes had the heart… 
to lose their lives out on a [F] limb
And all I re[Cmaj7]member… is thinking… 
I wanna be like [E7] them

[Am] Ever since I was little… 
Ever since I was little it looked like [Cmaj7] fun
And it's no coincidence I've co-[F]-me
And I can die when I'm do[E7]ne..

Maybe I'm [Am] crazy
Maybe you're [Cmaj7] crazy
Maybe we're [F] crazy
Probably [E7]...

[Am]... [Cmaj7]... [F]... [E7]...
