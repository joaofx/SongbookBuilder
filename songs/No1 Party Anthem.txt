[G] So you're on the [B] prowl wondering  whether [C]
She left already or not [C]
[Am] Leather jacket, collar [D] popped like Cantonna [G]
Never knowing when to stop [G]
[G] Sunglasses indoors, [B] par for the course
[C] Lights in the floors and [C] sweat on the walls [Am]
[D] Cages and [G] poles [G]

[G] Call off the search for your [B] soul
Or put it on [C] hold again
She's [C] having a sly indoor [Am] smoke
And she calls the [D] folks who run this, her [G] oldest friends
[G] Sipping a drink and [G] laughing at imaginary [B] jokes
As all the [C] signals are sent, [C] her eyes invite you to [Am] approach
And it seems as [D] though those lumps in your [Cm] throat
That you just [D] swallowed have got you going [G]

<b>(fingerstyle)</b>
[B] Come on, come on, come [Em] on 
[G7] Come on, come on, come [C] on 
Number [Cm] one party [G] anthem 
[G]

[G] She's a certi[B]fied mind blower
[C] Knowing full well [C] that I don't
[Am] May suggest there's [D] somewhere from which I might know [G] her
Just to get the ball to [G] roll
[G] Drunken monologues, [B] confused because
It's [C] not like I'm falling in [C] love, I just want you
To [Am] do me no [D] good
And you look [Cm] like you cou-[D]-uld  [G]

<b>(fingerstyle)</b>
[B] Come on, come on, come [Em] on 
[G7] Come on, come on, come [C] on 
Number [Cm] one party [G] anthem
<b>(strumming)</b>
[B] Come on, come on, come [Em] on 
[G7] Before the moment's go-[C]-one 
Number [Cm] one party [G] anthem, [G7] yeah, yeah

[C] The look of [Am] love, the rush of [Em] blood
The "She's with [Em] me"'s, the Gallic [C] shrug
The shutter[Am]bugs, the Camera [Em] Plus
The black & [Em] white and the color [C] dodge
The good time [Am] girls, the cubi[Em]cles
The house of [Am] fun, the number [C] one [C]
Party [D] anthem, [D] oh
