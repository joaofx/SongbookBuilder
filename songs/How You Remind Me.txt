<i>Verse</i>
[Bm] Never made it as a [E7] wise man

<i>Chorus</i>
[Bm] It's not like you [D] to say sorry
[A] Always waitin' on a [E7] different story
[Bm] This time I'm [D] mistaken
[A] For handin' you a he[E7]art worth breaking
[Bm//] And I've been wrong [D//] I've been down
[A] To the bottom of [E7] every bottle
[Bm] These five [D] words in my [A] head scream "Are we [E7]havin' fun yet?"
