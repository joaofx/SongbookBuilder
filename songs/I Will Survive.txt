Ps: If you feel [E] is hard, doing [E7] instead is fine

[Am/] First I was afraid I was [Dm/] petrified    
Kept thinking [G/] I could never live without you [C/] by my side    
But then I [F/] spent so many nights thinking [Dm/] how you did me wrong    
And I grew [E] strong and I learned [E7] how to get along  
{c: } 
And so you’re back [Am] back from outer [Dm] space    
I just walked [G] in to find you here with that sad [C] look upon your face    
I should have [F] changed that stupid lock    
I should have [Dm] made you leave your key    
If I had [E] known for just second you’d be [E7] back to bother me    
{c: } 
Go on now [Am] go, walk out the [Dm] door    
Just turn [G] around now, cause you’re not [C] welcome anymore    
[F] Weren’t you the one who tried to [Dm] hurt me with goodbyes?    
Did you think I’d [E] crumble? Did you think I’d [E7] lay down and die? 
{c: } 
Oh no not [Am] I, I will [Dm] survive    
For as [G] long as I know how to love I [C] know I’ll stay alive    
I’ve got [F] all my life to live, I’ve got [Dm] all my love to give    
And I’ll [E] survive, I will [E7] survive—hey hey   

[Am] [Dm] [G] [C] [F] [Dm]  [E7]

It took [Am] all the strength I had not to [Dm] fall apart,    
Kept trying [G] hard to mend the pieces of my [C] broken heart    
And I spent [F] oh so many nights just feeling [Dm] sorry for myself    
I used to [E] cry, but now I [E7] hold my head up high   
{c: } 
And you see [Am] me, somebody [Dm] new    
I’m not that [G] chained up little person still in [C] love with you    
And so you [F] felt like dropping in, and just [Dm] expect me to be free     
And now I’m [E] savin’ all my lovin’ for [E7] someone who’s lovin’ me   
{c: } 
Go on now [Am] go, walk out the [Dm] door    
Just turn [G] around now, cause you’re not [C] welcome anymore    
[F] Weren’t you the one who tried to [Dm] hurt me with goodbyes?    
Did you think I’d [E] crumble? Did you think I’d [E7] lay down and die?   
{c: } 
Oh no not [Am] I, I will [Dm] survive    
For as [G] long as I know how to love I [C] know I’ll stay alive    
I’ve got [F] all my life to live, I’ve got [Dm] all my love to give    
And I’ll [E] survive, I will [E7] survive—hey hey  

[Am] [Dm] [G] [C] [F] [Dm] [E7] [E7]

[Am/]
