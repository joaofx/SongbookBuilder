<i>(Down-Down)</i>
[Am]... [Am]... 

<i>Verse  (Down-Down)</i>
[Am] There's a fire [Em7] starting in my heart,
[G] Reaching a fever pitch and [Em7] it's bringing me out the dark
[Am] Finally, I can [Em7] see you crystal clear.
[G] Go ahead and sell me out and I'll [Em7] lay your ship bare

[Am] See how I leave, with [Em7] every piece of you
[G] Don't underestimate the [Em7] things that I will do.
[Am] There's a fire [Em7] starting in my heart,
[G] Reaching a fever pitch and it's [Em7] bringing me out the dark

[F] The scars of your [G] love, remind me of [Em7] us.
They keep me [F] thinking that we almost had it [F] all

The scars of your [G] love, they leave me [Em7] breathless
I can't help [F] feeling.. We could have had it 

<i>Chorus  (Down-Up)</i>
[Am] aaaa-aaa-[G]-all...
Rolling in the [F] Deee-eee-[G]-eep
Your had my heart [Am] insiiiide of your [G] hand
And you [F] played it To the [G] beat

<i>Verse  (Down-Down)</i>
[Am] Baby I have no [Em7] story to be told,
But [G] I've heard one of you and [Em7] I'm gonna make your head burn.
[Am] Think of me in the [Em7] depths of your despair.
[G] Making a home down there, [Em7] as mine sure won't be shared.

[F] The scars of your [G] love, remind me of [Em7] us.
They keep me [F] thinking that we almost had it [F] all
The scars of your [G] love, they leave me [Em7] breathless
I can't help [F] feeling...
