[C]..[Cmaj7]..[F]..[F].. x2

[C] Coming out of my [Cmaj7] cage and I've been doing just [F] fine
Gotta, gotta be down [F] because I want it all
[C] It started out with a [Cmaj7] kiss; how did it end up like [F] this?
It was only a [F] kiss; it was only a [C] kiss
Now I'm falling [Cmaj7] asleep and she's calling a [F] cab
While he's having a [F] smoke and she's taking a [C] drag
Now they're going to [Cmaj7] bed, and my stomach is [F] sick
And it's all in my [F] head, but she's touching his

[Am] Chest now, he takes off her
[G] Dress now, let me [F] go
[Am] And I just can't look; it's [G] killing me
They're ta[F]king control

[C] Jealousy, 
[F] turning saints in[Am]to the sea
[G] Swimming through sick [C] lullabies, 
[F] choking on your [Am] alibis
[G] But it's just the [C] price I pay,
[F] destiny is [Am] calling me
[G] Open up my [C] eager eyes [F], 
'cause [Am] I'm Mr. Brigh[G]tside
