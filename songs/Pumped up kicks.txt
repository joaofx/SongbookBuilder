<i>(intro)</i>
(pa-pa-papa)
[Em] ... [G] ... [D] ... [A] … <b>x2</b>

[Em] Robert's got a quick hand [G] ...
He'll [D] look around the room, but won't [A] tell you his plan
[Em] He's got a rolled cigarette [G]...
[D] Hanging out his mouth, he's a [A] cowboy kid, yeah

[Em] He found a six-shooter gun [G] 
In his [D] dad's closet, and with a [A] box of fun things
[Em] I don't even know wha-[G]-at
But he's [D] coming for you, yeah, he's [A] coming for you

<i>(chorus)</i> <b>x2</b>
[Em] All the other kids with the [G] pumped up kicks
You better [D] run, better run [A] outrun my gun
[Em] All the other kids with the [G] pumped up kicks
You better [D] run, better run [A] faster than my bullet

[Em]Daddy works a long day [G] ...
He'd be [D] coming home late, yeah, he's [A] coming home late
[Em] And he's bringing me a surprise [G] ...
'Cause [D] dinner's in the kitchen, and it's [A] packed in ice

[Em]I've waited for a long time [G] ...
Yeah, [D] the sleight of my hand is now a [A] quick pull trigger
[Em]I reason with my cigarette [G] ...
Then say, "Your [D] hair's on fire, you must have [A] lost your wits, yeah"

<i>(chorus)</i> <b>x2</b>
[Em] All the other kids with the [G] pumped up kicks
You better [D] run, better run [A] outrun my gun
[Em] All the other kids with the [G] pumped up kicks
You better [D] run, better run [A] faster than my bullet

<i>(no chords)</i>
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet

<i>(chorus)</i> <b>x2</b>
[Em] All the other kids with the [G] pumped up kicks
You better [D] run, better run [A] outrun my gun
[Em] All the other kids with the [G] pumped up kicks
You better [D] run, better run [A] faster than my bullet
