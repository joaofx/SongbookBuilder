Intro: 
[F] [A] 
[F] [A]

The [F] times we had
Oh, when the [A] wind would blow with rain and snow 
Were [F] not all bad 
We put our [A] feet just where they had 
Had to [F] go
Never to [A] go 
    
The [F] shattered soul 
Following [A] close but nearly twice as slow 
Were [F] my good times 
There were [A] always golden rocks to throw 
At [F] those who 
          
Those who [A] admit defeat too late 
Those were our [F] times 
Those were our [A] times

[Bb] [F] [Dm] [C]
                      
And [Bb] I will [F] love to see that [Dm] day
That [C] day is mine
When [Bb] she will [F] marry me
[Dm] Outside with [C] the willow trees
   
And [Bb] plaaa-aaa-[F]-aaying songs in [Dm] May    
What [C] made me so              
And [Bb] I would [F] love to see that [Dm] day
The [C/] (stop) the day was mine
