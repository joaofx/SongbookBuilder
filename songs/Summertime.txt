{c: } 
Summer [Am] time… [E7] and the livin’ is [Am] easy.   
Fish are [Dm] jumpin’… and the cotton is [E7] high.   
Your daddy’s [Am] rich… and your [E7] mamma’s good [Am] lookin’,   
So [C] hush little [Am] baby, [E7] don’t you [Am] cry.  
{c: } 
[Am] One of these mornings [E7],   
You’re going to rise up [Am] singing.   
Then you’ll [Dm] spread your wings,   
And you’ll take to the [E7] sky.   
But till that [Am] morning, [E7]   
There’s a’ nothing can [Am] harm you,   
With [C] daddy and [Am] mamma   
[E7] Standing [Am] by.
