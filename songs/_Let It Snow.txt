Intro: [G7] 

Oh, the [C//] weather [G7//] outside is [C] frightful
[C//] But the fire [D7//] is so de[G7]lightful
And [Dm//] since we've [A7//] no place to [Dm] go
Let it [G7] snow, let it snow, let it [C] snow

[C//] It doesn't show [G7//] signs of [C] stopping,
And I [C//] brought some [D7//] corn for [G7] popping
The [Dm//] lights are turned [A7//] way down [Dm] low
Let it [G7] snow, let it snow, let it [C] snow

When we [G] finally kiss good [G] night,
How I'll [Am//] hate going [D7//] out in the [G] storm
But if you [G] really hold me [G] tight
[A7//] All the way home [D7//] I'll be [G7] warm

[C//] The fire is [G7//] slowly [C] dying
And, my [C//] dear, we're [D7//] still good-[G7]bye-ing
[Dm//] But as long as you'd [A7//] love me [Dm] so,
Let it [G7] snow, let it snow, let it [C] snow

<i>(pa-pa-pa)</i>
[C//] [G7//] [C] ...
[C//] [D7//] [G7]...
[Dm//] [A7//] [Dm]...
[G7] ... [C] ...

When we [G] finally kiss good [G] night,
How I'll [Am//] hate going [D7//] out in the [G] storm
But if you [G] really hold me [G] tight
[A7//] All the way home [D7//] I'll be [G7] warm

Oh [C//] the fire is [G7//] slowly [C] dying
And, my [C//] dear, we're [D7//] still good-[G7]bye-ing
[Dm//] But as long as you'd [A7//] love me [Dm] so,
<b>(slowing down)</b>
Let it [G7] sno-o-ow, 
let it [G7] sno-o-ow,
let it [C] sno-o-o-o-
