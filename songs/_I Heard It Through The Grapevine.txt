It took me by surPRI-[Bm]-ISE I must [G] say
When I [Dm] found out yesterday

Ooh-ooh, [Dm] I heard it through the grapevine

You know [Dm] that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these [A7] tears I can't hold [G] inside
Losin' [Dm] YOU'd end my life you see
'Cause you [A7] mean that [G] much to me
You could've [Bm] TO-OLD me your[G]self

And I'm [G] just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey [Dm] yeah

People say [Dm] ha-alf from what you see
Nah-nah-[A7]none from what you [G] hear
I can't [Dm] HELP but bein' confused
If it's [A7] true, won't you [G] tell me here?
Do you [Bm]PLA-AN to let me go-o
For the other [Dm] guy that you knew [G] before?

Ooh-ooh, [Dm] I heard it through the grapevine
Not much [G] longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, [Dm] I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm [G] just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey [Dm] yeah
