<i>(intro)</i>
[Dm]

<i>(verse)</i>
[Dm] Meet you downstairs in the [Gm] bar and heard,
Your [A7] rolled up sleeves in your [Dm] skull t-shirt
You say, “What did you do wi-i-ith [Gm] him today?”
And [A7] sniffed me out like I was [Dm] Tanqueray

<i>(pre-chorus)</i>
[Gm] ... Cause you're my fella, my guy
[E7] ... Hand me your Stella and fly
[F] By the time I'm out the door
You [E7] tear men down like [A7] Roger Moore

<i>(chorus)</i>
[Dm] I cheated myself [Am]... 
like I [E7] knew... I [Am] would
I [Dm] told ya... I was [Am] trouble...
You [E7] know that I'm no [Am] good...

<i>(verse)</i>
[Dm] Upstairs in bed… with [Gm] my ex boy
[A7] He's in a place but I [Dm] can't get joy
Thinking of you… in the [Gm] final throes
[A7] This is when my [Dm] buzzer goes

<i>(pre-chorus)</i>
[Gm] Run out to meet your chips and pitta
[E7] You say, “When we're married,” cause you're not bitter
[F] There'll be none of him no more
I [E7] cried for you on the [A7] kitchen floor

<i>(chorus)</i>
[Dm] I cheated myself [Am]... 
like I [E7] knew... I [Am] would
I [Dm] told ya... I was [Am] trouble...
You [E7] know that I'm no [Am] good...
<!--actually here is the part that in the orginal is bridge with sax-->
<i>(bridge)</i>
Pa-ra-pa-pa [Dm] Pa-ra-pa-pa [Am] Pa-ra-pa-pa [E7] Pa-ra-pa-pa [Am] ...
Pa-ra-pa-pa [Dm] Pa-ra-pa-pa [Am] Pa-ra-pa-pa [E7] Pa-ra-pa-pa [Am] ...

<i>(verse)</i>
[Dm] Sweet reunion, Ja[Gm]maica and Spain
[A7] We're like how we [Dm] were again
I'm in the tub, you [Gm] on the seat
[A7] Lick your lips as I [Dm] soak my feet

<i>(pre-chorus)</i>
[Gm] Then you notice little carpet burn
[E7] My stomach drops a-and my guts churn
[F] You shrug… and it's the worst
To [E7] truly stuck the [A7] knife in first

<i>(chorus)</i>
[Dm] I cheated myself [Am]... 
like I [E7] knew... I [Am] would
I [Dm] told ya... I was [Am] trouble...
You [E7] know that I'm no [Am] good...

[Dm] I cheated myself [Am]... 
like I [E7] knew... I [Am] would
I [Dm] told ya... I-i was [Am] trouble...
Yea-You [E7] know that I'm no [Am] good...

<i>(outro)</i>
Pa-ra-pa-pa [Dm] Pa-ra-pa-pa [Am] Pa-ra-pa-pa [E7] Pa-ra-pa-pa [Am] ...
Pa-ra-pa-pa [Dm] Pa-ra-pa-pa [Am] Pa-ra-pa-pa [E7] Pa-ra-pa-pa [Am/]
