Intro [Dm]

[Dm]Meet you downstairs in the [Gm]bar and heard,
Your [A7]rolled up sleeves in your [Dm]skull t-shirt
You say, “What did you do with [Gm]him today?”
And [A7]sniffed me out like I was [Dm]Tanqueray

[Gm] Cause you're my fella, my guy
[E7] Hand me your Stella and fly
[F]By the time I'm out the door
You [E7]tear men down like [A7]Roger Moore

[Dm] I cheated myself… [Am] like I [E7]knew… I [Am]would
I [Dm]told ya… I was [Am]trouble…
You [E7]know that I'm no [Am] good

[Dm] Upstairs in bed… with [Gm]my ex boy
[A7]He's in a place but I [Dm]can't get joy
Thinking of you… in the [Gm]final throes
[A7]This is when my [Dm]buzzer goes

[Gm] Run out to meet your chips and pitta
[E7]You say, “When we're married,” cause you're not bitter
[F]There'll be none of him no more
I [E7]cried for you on the [A7]kitchen floor

[Dm] I cheated myself [Am] like I [E7]knew
I [Am]would I [Dm]told ya I was [Am]trouble
You [E7]know that I'm no [Am] good

[Dm] Sweet reunion… Ja[Gm]maica and Spain
[A7]We're like how we… [Dm]were again
I'm in the tub… you [Gm]on the seat
[A7]Lick your lips as I [Dm]soak my feet

[Gm] Then you notice little carpet burn
[E7] My stomach drops… and my guts churn
[F] You shrug… and it's the worst
To [E7]truly stuck the [A7]knife in first

[Dm] I cheated myself… [Am] like I [E7]knewI [Am]would
I [Dm]told ya… I was [Am]trouble…
You [E7]know that I'm no [Am] good

[Dm] I cheated myself… [Am] like I [E7]knew I [Am]would
I [Dm]told ya… I was [Am]trouble…
You [E7]know that I'm no [Am] good
