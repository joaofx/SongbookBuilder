If you  [C] close the  [A7] door
The  [Dm] night could last for[G]ever
Leave the  [C] sunshine  [A7] out
And [Dm] say hello to  [G] never
All the  [C] people are dancing
And they're  [C7] having such fun
I  [F] wish it could happen to  [Fm/] me [stop] 
But if you  [C] close the  [A7] door
I'd  [Dm//] never have to  [G//] see the day  [C] again

If you  [C] close the  [A7] door
The  [Dm] night could last  [G] forever
Leave the  [C] wineglass  [A7] out
And  [Dm] drink a toast to  [G] never
Oh,  [C] someday I know
Someone will  [C7] look into my eyes
And say  [F/] hello
You're my very special  [Fm/] one
But if you  [C] close the  [A7] door
I'd  [Dm//] never have to  [G//] see the day  [C//] again  [B//] 
<b>(down down strum)</b>
[Em] Dark party bars, shiny  [B] Cadillac cars
And the  [Em//] people on  [B//] subways and  [Em//] trains [Ebm/] [Em/]  <!-- check -->
Looking  [Am] gray in the rain as they  [Am] stand disarrayed
Oh, but  [Dm] people look well in the  [G/] dark  [stop] 

If you  [C] close the  [A7] door
The  [Dm] night could last for[G]ever
Leave the  [C] sunshine  [A7] out
And [Dm] say hello to  [G] never
All the  [C] people are dancing
And they're  [C7] having such fun
I  [F] wish it could happen to  [Fm] me
But if you  [C] close the  [A7] door
I'd  [Dm//] never have to  [G//] see the day  [C//] again  [A7//] 
I'd  [Dm//] never have to  [G//] see the day  [C//] again  [A7//], once more
I'd  [Dm//] never have to  [G//] see the day  [C/] again
