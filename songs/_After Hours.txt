If you [C] close the [A7] door
The [Dm] night could last for[G]ever
Leave the [C] sunshine [A7] out
And [Dm] say hello to [G] never
All the [C] people are dancing
And they're [C7] having such fun
I [F] wish it could happen to [Fm/] me [stop] 
But if you [C] close the [A7] door
I'd [Dm//] never have to [G//] see the day [C] again

If you [C] close the [A7] door
The [Dm] night could last [G] forever
Leave the [C] wineglass [A7] out
And [Dm] drink a toast to [G] never
Oh, [C] someday I know
Someone will [C7] look into my eyes
And say [F/] "hello - 
You're my very special [Fm/] one"
But if you [C] close the [A7] door
I'd [Dm//] never have to [G//] see the day [C//] again [B//] 
<b>(down down strum)</b>
[Em] Dark party bars, shiny [B] Cadillac cars
And the [Em//] people on [B//] subways and [Em//] trains [Ebm/] [Em/] <!-- check -->
Looking [Am] gray in the rain as they [Am] stand disarrayed
Oh, but [Dm/] people look [Dm/] well in the [G/] dark [stop] 
<b>(normal strum)</b>
If you [C] close the [A7] door
The [Dm] night could last for[G]ever
Leave the [C] sunshine [A7] out
And [Dm] say hello to [G] never
All the [C] people are dancing
And they're [C7] having such fun
I [F] wish it could happen to [Fm] me
But if you [C] close the [A7] door
I'd [Dm//] never have to [G//] see the day [C//] again [A7//] 
I'd [Dm//] never have to [G//] see the day [C//] again [A7//], once more
I'd [Dm//] never have to [G//] see the day [C/] again
