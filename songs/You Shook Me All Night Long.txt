She was a [G] fast machine, she kept her [C] motor clean
She was the [D] best damn woman I had [G] ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling [C] me no lies
[D] Knockin' me out with those A[G]merican thighs

Taking [G] more than her share, had me [C] fighting for air
She [D] told me to come, but I was [G] already there
'Cause the [G] walls start shaking, the [C] earth was quaking
My [D] mind was aching, and [D7] we were making it

And [G] you shook me [C] all [G] night [D] long [C] [D]
And [G] you shook me [C] all [G] night [D] long [C] [D]

Working [G] double time on the [C] seduction line
She was [D] one of a kind, she's just [G] mine, all mine
She wanted no applause, just a[C]nother course
Made a [D] meal out of me and [G] came back for more

Had to [G] cool me down to take a[C]nother round,
Now I'm [D] back in the ring to take a[G]nother swing.
'Cause the [G] walls were shaking, the [C] earth was quaking
My [D] mind was aching, and [D7] we were making it

And [G] you shook me [C] all [G] night [D] long [C] [D]
And [G] you shook me [C] all [G] night [D] long [C] [D]

And [G] you shook me [C] all [G] night [D] long [C] [D]
And [G] you shook me [C] all [G] night [D] long [C] [D] [D7] [G]
