[NC] 
My friend's got a girlfriend, man, he hates that bitch
He tells me every day
He says, "Man, I really gotta lose my chick
In the worst kind of way"

[F] She sits on her ass, [Bb] he works his hands to the bone
[F] To give her money every [C] payday
[F] But she wants more dinero just to [Bb] stay at home
Well, my [F//] friend, you [C//] gotta [F] say

[F] I won't pay, I won't pay ya, [Bb] no way
[F//] Na-na, why [C//] don't you get a [F] job?
[F] Say no way, say no way-ah, [Bb] no wa-a-a-ay
[F//] Na-na, why [C//] don't you get a [F//] job?

[F] I guess all his money, well, it [Bb]isn't enough
[F] To keep the bill collectors at [C] bay
[F] I guess all his money, well, it [Bb]isn't enough
'Cause that [F//] girl's got [C//] expensive [F] taste

[F] I won't pay, I won't pay ya, [Bb] no way
[F//] Na-na, why [C//] don't you get a [F] job?
[F] Say no way, say no way-ah, [Bb] no wa-a-a-ay
[F//] Na-na, why [C//] don't you get a [F//] job?

[Bb] Well, I guess it ain't easy doing nothing at [F] aaaall, oh yeah
[Bb] But, hey man, free rides just don't come [G] along every [C] day
(Let me tell you about my other friend now)

[F] My friend's got a boyfriend, man, she [Bb] hates that dick
[F] She tells me every [C] day
[F] He wants more dinero just to [Bb] stay at home
Well, my [F//] friend, you [C//] gotta [F] say

[F] I won't pay, I won't pay ya, [Bb] no way
[F//] Na-na, why [C//] don't you get a [F] job?
[F] Say no way, say no way-ah, [Bb] no wa-a-a-ay
[F//] Na-na, why [C//] don't you get a [F//] job?

[F] I won't pay, I won't pay ya, [Bb] no way
[F//] Na-na, why [C//] don't you get a [F] job?
[F] Say no way, say no way-ah, [Bb] no wa-a-a-ay
[F//] Na-na, why [C//] don't you get a [F//] job?
