My friend's got a girlfriend, man, he hates that bitch
He tells me every day
He says, "Man, I really gotta lose my chick
In the worst kind of way"
She sits on her ass, he works his hands to the bone
To give her money every payday
But she wants more dinero just to stay at home
Well, my friend, you gotta say
I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?
Say no way, say no way-ah, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?
I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough
To keep the bill collectors at bay
I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough
'Cause that girl's got expensive taste
I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?
Say no way, say no way-ah, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?
Well, I guess it ain't easy doing nothing at all, oh yeah
But, hey man, free rides just don't come along every day
(Let me tell you about my other friend now)
My friend's got a boyfriend, man, she hates that dick
She tells me every day
He wants more dinero just to stay at home
Well, my friend, you gotta say
I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?
Say no way, say no way-ah, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?
I won't give you no money, I always pay
Na-na, why don't you get a job?
Say no way, say no way-ah, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?
<--!Hey, that's something everyone can enjoy-->
