<i>Verse</i>
[Am]  Feeling my [F] way through the [C] darkness [G] 
[Am]  Guided [F] by a beating [C] heart [E7] 
[Am]  I canâ€™t [F] tell where the [C] journey will [G] end 
[Am]  But I [F] know where to [C] start [E7]
[Am]  They tell me [F] Iâ€™m too [C] young to under [G]stand 
[Am]  They say Iâ€™m [F] caught up in a [C] dream [E7]
[Am]  Well life will [F] pass me by if [C] I donâ€™t open up [G] my eyes 
[Am]  Well thatâ€™s [F] fine by [C] me 
 
<i>Chorus</i>
[E7//] So wake me [Am] up when [F] itâ€™s all [C] over
[G] When Iâ€™m [Am] wiser [F] and Iâ€™m [C] older 
[E7] All this [Am] time I was [F] finding my[C]self and I [G]
[Am] didnâ€™t [F] know I was [C] lost 
[E7] So wake me [Am] up when [F] itâ€™s all [C] over 
[G]  When Iâ€™m [Am] wiser [F] and Iâ€™m [C] older   
[E7] All this [Am] time I was [F] finding my[C]self and I [G]
[Am] didnâ€™t [F] know I was [C] lost [E7]

<i>Verse </i>
[Am]  I tried [F] carrying the [C] weight of the [G]  world
[Am]  But I [F] only have two [C] hands [E7]
[Am]  Hope I get [F] the chance to [C] travel the [G]  world 
[Am]  And I donâ€™t [F] have any [C] plans [E7]  
[Am]  Wish that I [F] could stay for[C]ever this young [G] 
[Am]  Not a[F]fraid to close my [C] eyes [E7]
[Am]  Lifeâ€™s a [F] game made for [C] every [G]one 
[Am]  And [F] love is a p[C]rize
