Intro:
[Gm] [Eb] [Bb] [F]
[Gm] [Eb] [Bb] [F]

[Gm] Come to decide that [Eb] the things that I tried
[Bb] were in my life just [F] to get high on.
[Gm] When I sit alone, [Eb] come, get a little known,
[Bb] but I need more than [F] myself this time.

[Gm] Step from the road to the [Eb] sea to the sky,
[Bb] and I do believe [F] what we rely on.
[Gm] When I lay it on, [Eb] come, get to play it 
[Bb] on all my life [F] to sacrifice.

[Gm] say, [Eb] oh. [Bb] [F]

[Gm] say, [Eb] oh. [Bb] [F]

[Gm] When will know that [Eb] really can't go
[Bb] to the well one more time [F] to decide on.
[Gm] When it's killing me, [Eb]  when will really see,
[Bb] all that I need to [F] look inside

[Gm] Come to believe that I [Eb] better not leave,
[Bb] before I get my [F] chance to ride.
[Gm] When it's killing me, [Eb] what do I really need,
[Bb] all that I need to [F] look inside

[Gm] Hey [Eb] oh, [Bb] listen [F] what I 
[Gm] say, [Eb] oh. [Bb] [F]

[Bb] Deep beneath the cover of 
[F] another perfect wonder, where 
[Cm] it's so white as [Cm] snow...

[Bb] Privately divided by a 
[F] world so undecided, and there's 
[Cm] nowhere to [Cm] go...

[Bb] In between the cover of 
[F] another perfect wonder,
where [Cm] it's so white as [Cm] snow...

[Bb] Running through the field where all my 
[F] tracks will be concealed,
and there's [Cm] nowhere to [Cm] go.

[Gm] [Eb] [Bb] [F]

[Gm] When to descend to [Eb] amend for a friend,
[Bb] all the channels that have [F] broken down.
[Gm] Now you bring it up, [Eb] I'm gonna ring it up,
[Bb] just to hear you [F] sing it out.

[Gm] Step from the road to [Eb] the sea to the sky,
and I [Bb] do believe what [F] we rely on.
[Gm] When I lay it on, [Eb] come, get to play it on,
[Bb] all my life to [F] sacrifice.
